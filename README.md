# About the projeckt

As part of the Modern Database Systems project, we had a task to clone a platform that requires different databases to perform their respective subtasks. Our group developed Cloneflix, a clone of the Netflix platform. 

The backend was mainly handled by Igor Ferbert and Abdullatif Kikhia, who wanted to expand their knowledge in this area (Spring Boot). 

The frontend and devops tasks were handled by Max Bohlen, who already had experience with React (React Native) and Docker.

Jiafan Gao and Tea Dusic were responsible for project management (Kanban board).
